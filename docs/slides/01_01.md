# CSS Clamp()
Responsive Content Without Media Queries

I'm really enjoying a CSS function called Clamp

# CSS Clamp()

```css
clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX);
```

It's better than using a width property because you can set up a minimum and maximum value, which are the clamps. Picture in your mind how you might use clamps when woodworking to limit the movement of something like your circular saw.

# Where can I use it?

`length` `frequency` `angle` `time` `percentage` `number` `integer`

You can use it to limit all types of values wherever you use properties like length, frequency angles, etc. You can use measurements like percentages or any of the viewport measurements, so it's more flexible than just a hard value.

# The Hero


```html
<img src=img.jpg" alt="some image"/>
```

```css
width: 100%;
```

Say you have an hero image for your site:

To make this fit the width of the display, in CSS, you might try making the width 100%.

But sometimes you don't want the image to go the full width. You might want some constraints to that width. This is where clamp() can come in handy.

# First Clamp

```css
img {
  width: clamp(800px, 100%, 1200px);
}
```

> >

This will make the image try to be 100% of the width of the container, but also no smaller than 800 pixels and no larger than 1200 pixels.

Normally, I'd take care of this by creating a div that contains the image, but clamp() is letting me put this directly on the image, so that's less, more flexible code.

# Content Images

```
float: right;
width: clamp(300px, 50%, 600px);
```

I could definitely use something like this for images in the main content section of a site. The problem here is that responsive images get too big or two small, so a percentage never works well.

Now you have an image that doesn't get too big or too small.

# What about fonts?

```
font-size:  clamp(2em, 4vw, 3.2em);
```

You can also use this to create responsive font sizes. The typical way is to use a complex `calc()` function, but with the clamp() function, it's easy to establish a range of values.

I'm using viewport widths here, so that's making the font responsive to the size of the browser. Just remember that 100vw means 100% of the viewport width and that would be a HUGE font size, so a fairly small size here. To me, this type of sizing is easier to read than a complex calc().

It's got pretty good [browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=clamp), so I think that unless you're supporting really old browsers it's something you can start using today.

# Practice

<div class="btn-group mt-3" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
  <a type="button" class="animate__animated animate__backInLeft btn btn-lg btn-exciting text-white" href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/VwmQdBv?editors=1100" target="_blank">Start</a>
  <a type="button" class="animate__animated animate__backInRight animate__slow btn btn-lg btn-primary text-white" href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/vYyRpMb?editors=1100" target="_blank">End</a>
</div>

Here's what we did and where you can find the code in Github. Remember that the code is always at `raybo.org/slides_tailwind`
