Alrighty...welcome to the launch. Some notes here, You can find the slides I'm using here at raybo.org/slides_thelaunch.

I'm using this for this and all future episodes of the launch, so to get to today's demo, just hit the m key and then click on the React and GraphQL link.

I plan to do a Launch LiveStream about once a month, so you can follow me on LinkedIn or YouTube if you want to keep track of what I'm up to.
